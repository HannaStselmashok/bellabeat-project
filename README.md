Google Analytics Capstone Project - Bellabeat

1. Ask phase
Questions to be unswered:
- What are some trends in smart device usage?
- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

2. Prepare phase
The data (CSV files) was downloaded to my computer. After inspection of tables I realised that files with weight and heartrate have too small sample (8 and 7 users). So I didtn't use them in my analysis.
The next step was to implement right formats for data (date, numbers, etc.)
Since the dataset are not very big I decided to use excel for cleaning and analysis and Tableau for visualization.

3. Proccess phase
The data was inspected for anomalies.
